In a shop, discounts were provided as below. 
- If the label price of an item is more than Rs.400, then the discount is 20%.
- If the label price of an item is more than Rs.500, then the discount is 25%.
- If the label price of an item was more than or equal to Rs.1000, then the discount is 50%.
- Finally if the total purchase amount after discount is more than Rs.2000 a further discount of Rs.100 is provided.

#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int i;
    float a[n],total=0;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%f",&a[i]);
        if(a[i]>=1000)
        a[i]*=.5;
        else if(a[i]>500)
        a[i]-=(a[i]*.25);
        else if(a[i]>400)
        a[i]-=(a[i]*.2);

        total+=a[i];
    }
    if(total>2000)
    {
        total-=100;
    }
    printf("%.2f",total);
}

Input:
3 
1000 1200 400 

Output: 
1500.00

Explanation:
1000,1200,400 after discount becomes 500,600,400 
(20% discount is applicable only if the label price is more than Rs.400)
Hence net payable amount = 500+600+400 = 1500
