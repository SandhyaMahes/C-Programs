Instead of K the keyboard may sometimes display T (but will never display K instead of T)
Similarly instead of G, the keyboard may sometimes display D,
instead of R sometimes it may display L and
sometimes instead of R it displays F.

#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char s[101];
    int l,i,count=0;
    scanf("%s%n",s,&l);
    for(i=0;i<l;i++)
    {
        if(s[i]=='T' || s[i]=='D' || s[i]=='L' || s[i]=='F')
        count++;
    }
    printf("%.0lf",pow(2,count));
}

Input:
FILIPEK 

Output: 
4

Explanation:
The words that may be wrongly typed are F and L.
Here F could be correctly typed or wrongly typed instead of R.
Similarly L could be correctly typed or wrongly typed instead of R.
Hence the overall words to be considered are 2*2 = 4.
Note: K is not considered as K will not be typed instead of some other letter.
Only instead of K sometimes T will be typed.
